# Razorpay Integration 

1. firstly you can go to the Razorpay site and login then get a api key and secret from accounts and settings and 
then create a plan in subscriptions tab in plans 
2. secondly you can go to the razorpay dev website and go to the developer tools > server side sdks > know more > Node.js > Build integration 
3. create a instance in the server.js > make a payment route > payment controller
4. now at the razorpay dev go the subscription tab  > subscription apis > create a subscription. and you will see here plan id and total cound is mandatory fields.

5. after hiting the subscribe api then we can hit the payment verification api 
so in razor pay there will be two methods handler function and callback url. you can check it out by following :-
razorpay dev website > devtools > sample apps > js docs > integration steps > build integration and here you can check handler function or callback url

6. and here we are hiting our paymentverification api by callback url. 

Note: if we use handler function then it will give these three
        alert(response.razorpay_payment_id);
        alert(response.razorpay_order_id); //order ki jgha hame subscription_id milegi
        alert(response.razorpay_signature);

        but we are using the callback url so in this urls controller we can get these from the req.body vo razorpay khud hi bhejga

7. verify these above three. webpage in point no. 5 gives how to verify signature so you can checkout from that 
8. we are creating payments model this will help for refund we can check from created now if it will withing 7 days then we will refund.
in refund process we need a razorpay key so we can make a small functino and route for it
